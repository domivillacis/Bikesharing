# NYC Citi Bike Analysis & Visualisation

## Overview

Citi Bike is a bike sharing app that has successfully served millions of customers in beautiful New York City. 

Together with my great friend Kate, we decided to do an analysis to see if this business model would work in her hometown of Des Moines.

Kate found a potential angel investor who might be interested in providing seed funds to start a bike-share program in Des Moines, so we're going to provide a bike trip analysis.

To perform this analysis, we're going to use Tableau and extract data from a CSV file which we will get from the Citi Bike program website in New York City  [link](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data)

As everyone knows, Tableau is a great tool for data visualization, especially since it's easy to use and understand.

## Results

Tableau has been very helpful in getting this analysis started as we were able to make comparisons between the different charts we created.

Here, I'll quickly explain the overview.

As we can see in our viz, in the month of August, 2,344,224 people used the app, which is not only a high number, but also means that using a bike was much more useful than taking the subway for many users in NYC.

Of this number, about 1.5 million users are men, a little over half a million are women, and we also have "unknown" customers who did not fill out that information but they are a little over 200k.

A very important and useful piece of information for our finding is that at least 85% of all customers are subscribed to this service, which means that people who live, visit or spend time in the city center are very supportive of this idea.

Now, I'll walk you through some important findings.

### Checkout Times for Users

In this viz, we can see that some users had very short trip durations around 12, 1 and 2am. Of course, those are not popular hours to use the bike sharing app. If we change the filter from 10 am to 4pm, we'll see the difference in trip durantion.

### Checkout Times by Gender

As I mentioned earlier, the majority of Citi Bike subscribers are male riders and this viz allows us to see what the ride duration was byt gender by hour. Typically the most popular times to use this service are during the day or during peak hours (7-9am ot 4-7pm)

### Trips by Weekday per Hour

We decided to create a heatmap with the number of bike trips per day of the week that will allow us to see the most popular times for each hour of the day.

The most popular times to use the service in the morning are Monday through Friday at 8 am, and in the afternoon are Monday, Tuesday and Thursday from 5 to 6 pm, with up to 44,905 passengers. Those times are usually related to rush hour and it is also important for tourists, who decide to leave early to explore the city and return before dinner.

### Trips by Gender

The most popular times for using the app are mentioned above, however, based on customer gender, male customers use this service the most, especially in the afternoon from 5-6 PM. m. on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays.

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday

As we know, NYC is such a popular city in the world that it attracts millions of tourists daily, so our heat map shows us that there are many customers among men, women and unknown gender who use the service during weekdays and weekends.

For subscribers, on the other hand, the cifer fluctuates. The highest number of male subscribers using the app is 259,316 while for female users it's 88,281 and we can attribute this to different reasons, one may be the weather condition as August may be too hot to cycle to work, for example.
