# NYC Citi Bike Analysis & Visualisation

## Overview

Citi Bike is a bike sharing app that has successfully served millions of customers in beautiful New York City. 

Together with my great friend Kate, we decided to do an analysis to see if this business model would work in her hometown of Des Moines.

Kate found a potential angel investor who might be interested in providing seed funds to start a bike-share program in Des Moines, so we're going to provide a bike trip analysis.

To perform this analysis, we're going to use Tableau and extract data from a CSV file which we will get from the Citi Bike program website in New York City  [link](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data)

As everyone knows, Tableau is a great tool for data visualization, especially since it's easy to use and understand.

We'll take you for a ride! Are you ready? ðŸš²
