# NYC Citi Bike Analysis & Visualisation

## Overview

Citi Bike is a bikesharing application that has successfully served millions of customers in the beautiful city of New York. Together with my great friend Kate, we decided to make an analysis to see if this business model would work in her hometown, Des Moines.

Kate found a potential angel investor who might be interested in providing seed funding to start a bikes-hare program in Des Moines, for that reason, we're going to provide a bike trip analysis.

To perform this analysis, we're going to extract data from a CSV file, that we'll get from the Citi Bike program in New York City web page [at this link](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data)

As you all know, Tableau, is an excellent tool for data visualisation, espcially because it's easy to use and understand.

Let's explore Des Moine! ðŸš²
